        <div>Have you any programming or web design experience?</div>
        <div>Yes I have. Well, I like to think so ...</div>

        <div>Do you see yourself as a programmer or designer, or both?</div>
        <div>I would like to consider myself as a programmer more for now but I hope that I could be good at both of the
          positions in the near future. </div>

        <div>What has brought you to this course at RMIT?</div>
        <div>Since this course is one of the essential courses which has been opened for us by the leaders of the
          Bachelof of IT Program, so I think it is kinda fair to say that the teachers and the professors are the reason
          for us to be here. Really like it when I have the opportunity to play with the website stuffs. </div>

        <div>What are you hoping to get out of the course?</div>
        <div>Learn and practice regularly.</div>

        <div>Assignments allow for individual or paried work. What strengths do you have and what strengths would you
          like your assignment partner to have?</div>
        <div>Coding and critical thinking are not really my strengths but I could be a responsible teammate and also a contributor. <br>
          The one who is responsible and not too strict could be a great partner for me.</div>

        <div>What websites do you use the most? (NB: "family friendly" !)</div>
        <div>Top 3 in order: Facebook (mostly for communicating with friends xD) - Youtube (for entertainment) - RMIT
          Canvas (for a bright future of mine)</div>

        <div>Do you have any interests or hobbies?</div>
        <div>YÃ©s, I do. I am a music person and I am also a big fan of Volleyball.</div>
